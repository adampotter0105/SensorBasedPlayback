# SensorBasedPlayback
Fourth draft of PID playback with gyro correction for VEX robots. The basic idea is that the at every given second the robot is either slowing down or speeding up either side of the drive to meet it's desired encoder values and gyro angles. While in a sense it is still timing based, it should be an improvement of power and timing playback.
